# Diamond Price Prediction in SAS
 A complete data science process poject with SAS
 ## Introduction
 Diamonds have been believed to bring luck â€“ health, wealth and protection against most of the ills that can befall mankind. They are a multi-billion-dollar business. The worldwide retail market for diamond jewelry was $60 billion in 2010. 
 
Recently, a diamond distributor decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase but is unsure how much it should bid.

Among a matrix of techniques of data science, SAS is recognized as one of the most powerful data science machine learning tools in data exploration, data mining and predictive analysis. This project will use Base SAS 9.4 M6 and SAS Enterprise Guide 8.1 to conduct the diamond data exploration and diamond price prediction. 

## Objectives
The data science team was tasked to collect the historical diamond data set and conduct the data science project to provide the actionable insights about diamond dataset and predict the prices for 3,000 diamonds to bid. 

The objectives are to: 
*	Establish the Lifecycle pipeline of data science process
*	Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*	Build Machine Learning model
*	Predict prices of Diamonds
*	Provide recommendations

## Assumptions
We assume that historical diamond data was collected from the current retial market. The diamond price that the model predicts represents the final retail price the consumer will pay. The company generally purchases diamonds from distributors at 70% of the retail price, so the recommended bid price will represent that.

## Lifecycle Data Science Process
Diamond price prediction is a project with a lifecyle of data science process, which includes data collection, data exploratory analysis (EDA), feature engineering (FE), feature selection (FS), model building, model evaluation, price prediction and and recommendations.
